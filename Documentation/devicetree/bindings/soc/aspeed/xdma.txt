Aspeed AST25XX and AST26XX XDMA Engine

The XDMA Engine embedded in the AST2500 and AST2600 SOCs can perform automatic
DMA operations over PCI between the SOC (acting as a BMC) and a host processor.

Required properties:
 - compatible		: must be "aspeed,ast2500-xdma" or
			  "aspeed,ast2600-xdma"
 - reg			: contains the address and size of the memory region
			  associated with the XDMA engine registers
 - resets		: reset specifier for the syscon reset associated with
			  the XDMA engine
 - interrupts-extended	: two interrupt nodes; the first specifies the global
			  interrupt for the XDMA engine and the second
			  specifies the PCI-E reset or PERST interrupt.

Example:

    xdma@1e6e7000 {
        compatible = "aspeed,ast2500-xdma";
        reg = <0x1e6e7000 0x100>;
        resets = <&syscon ASPEED_RESET_XDMA>;
        interrupts-extended = <&vic 6>, <&scu_ic ASPEED_AST2500_SCU_IC_PCIE_RESET_LO_TO_HI>;
    };
